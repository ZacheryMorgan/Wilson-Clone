# Tools
- React
- Tailwind
- React-icons
- React-router-dom

### Just to Practice
- Fully built mobile first with Tailwind and Sass for media queries.
- Random theme to practice customizing images with compressors / resizing to be more efficient with picture / srcset.

### TODO
- Add more pages, shop is working with a mapped over object I wrote, but it's barebones.
- Build API using my own shell data.
